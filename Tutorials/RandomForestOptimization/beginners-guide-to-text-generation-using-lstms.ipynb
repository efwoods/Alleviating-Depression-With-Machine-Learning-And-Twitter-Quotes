Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word based on the previous sequence of words used in the text. Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level.

This state allows the neurons an ability to remember what have been learned so far.\n","\n","The memory state in RNNs gives an advantage over traditional neural networks but a problem called Vanishing Gradient is associated with them.
